# Search terms for finding appropriate papers for the synthesis

("eDNA" OR "environmental DNA" OR "metabarcoding" OR "eRNA" OR "environmental RNA") AND ("biodiversity" OR "species richness" OR "monitoring" OR "biomonitoring") AND ("high throughput sequencing" OR "HTS" OR "throughput")

###

("environmental DNA" OR "eDNA" OR "metabarcoding" OR "environmental RNA" OR "eRNA")
* 'Diatom DNA Metabarcoding' paper doesn’t use the terms related to 'eDNA', so is missed using this string…

("biodiversity" OR "species richness" OR "monitoring" OR "biomonitoring")

("high throughput sequencing" OR "HTS" OR "throughput")
* 'Annual Time-Series' benchmark paper may require the use of 'throughput' as a search string

## Results
Using the three above brackets returns:
* 417 results in PubMed
* 1,841 results in PubMed without the HTS bracket






## Other possible search strings

NOT ("qPCR" OR "quantitative PCR")
* This would miss papers dealing with qPCR AND eDNA

NOT ("ddPCR" OR "droplet digital PCR")
