# Search terms for finding appropriate papers for the synthesis

("eDNA" OR "environmental DNA" OR "metabarcoding" OR "eRNA" OR "environmental RNA") AND ("biodiversity" OR "species richness" OR "monitoring" OR "biomonitoring") AND ("high throughput sequencing" OR "HTS" OR "throughput")

###

("environmental DNA" OR "eDNA" OR "metabarcoding" OR "environmental RNA" OR "eRNA")
* 'Diatom DNA Metabarcoding' paper doesn’t use the terms related to 'eDNA', so is missed using this string…

("biodiversity" OR "species richness" OR "monitoring" OR "biomonitoring")

("high throughput sequencing" OR "HTS" OR "throughput")
* 'Annual Time-Series' benchmark paper may require the use of 'throughput' as a search string

## Results

BASE - API key required...
DIVA - 334 hits (with a query of 'eDNA' only'; 22 if the full query is used)
Libris - 11 hits (1,391 if we use only 'eDNA')
Swepub - 33 hits (342 if we use only 'eDNA')
PubMed - 417 hits
Scopus - API key required...
Worldcat - API key required...

Note that 'eDNA' is not searched for in a case-sensitive manner, so some spurious hits arise when using 'eDNA' as the sole search term


## Other possible search strings

NOT ("qPCR" OR "quantitative PCR")
* This would miss papers dealing with qPCR AND eDNA

NOT ("ddPCR" OR "droplet digital PCR")
